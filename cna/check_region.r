# quantify the copy number of every tissue-specific segment
#   divide this by purity to get the cancer copies

# compare within-segment vs. outside of segment
#   and TF targets vs non-TF targets (FET?)


# plot total number of amp segments (/genes?) per cancer type

# plot enrichment of amp/del in segments per method
